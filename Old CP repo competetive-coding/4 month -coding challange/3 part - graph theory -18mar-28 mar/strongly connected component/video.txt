very good video



steps:-
1)build graph
2)dfs on each vertix;
3)when all the adjaceent vertex of a vertix ix visited make push to stack apart from recursive stack;
4)traspose the graph;
5)make all visi vertic to unvisited veritex
6)again start dfs on pop one by one frok start as atarting node and simultaneously use visited to make vis nodes visited;
5)this traspose graph give connected components on a loop on amin progRAM;
