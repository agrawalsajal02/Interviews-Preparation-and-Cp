if you are taking data type sttring then calling length function is a constant time because it stores the length internally


but but but


if you are taking character string and using strlen function it is o(n) operation 
and further more if you are iteration over the length of string in this way

for(lli=0;i<strlen(n);i++){


}


then every time the strlen function call on every j making time complexity n square
therefore it is better to store the strlen in a variable before loop

ll p=strlen(n);

for(lli=0;i<strlen(n);i++){


}
