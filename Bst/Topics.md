1) creating inserting searching and deleting the bst  

2) find ceil , floor ,greater and smaller in bst

3)given a bst , where two nodes are swapped , find out the the swapped node or correct the bst

4)find pair of nodes with given sum (3 approches )
    a)hashing
    b)sordig then binary search
    c)two pointer approch (important , initiliztion of forward and backword pointer)
  
5)Given an array , find previous greater and value wise closest element for every element

6)find kth smallest elemnt in bst
  two methods
    1)using pbds
    2)using inorder traversal  and keep count
    2)mpdifying the structure , given count of nodes that in left of subtree 
    
 7)how to do reverse inoder traversal in bst
